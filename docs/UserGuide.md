## 4.0 Other Features

This section covers some of the features which do not rely on your input to be executed. Rather, they happen in the 
background without any input from you necessary.

### 4.1 Storing Data

By default, **LifEasier** creates a save folder named “LifEasierSaves” in the same folder `LifEasier.jar` is run. 
**LifEasier** data is saved automatically to the hard disk when a new event, deadline, lesson or notes is added, 
deleted or edited. Data is stored in text files, in plaintext. This allows you to edit your data directly through 
the save files if necessary.

### 4.2 Recurring Tasks and Auto Deletion

**LifEasier** automatically updates the dates of recurring tasks and deletes old tasks.
It will load your save files and update your tasks automatically every time it starts up.
Here are some examples of what might happen if you start up **LifEasier** on 24th October:

1. If you had a lesson that last occurred on 22nd October, and it is set to repeat 3 more times, it will be updated to occur again on 29th October, and updated to repeat 2 more times.
2. If you had an event that last occurred on 21st October, and it is set to repeat 0 more times, it will be deleted from your schedule.


## 5.0 FAQ

**The following FAQ section answers some common questions that you may have about the LifEasier application.**

**Q: Can I use my LifEasier saves on another computer?**
**A:** Yes you can. You can transfer your files from one computer to another, and place them in a folder called “LifEasierSaves”. Then, run `LifEasier.jar` from the same folder as “LifEasierSaves”. Your saves should be loaded into LifEasier. As long as the “LifEasierSaves” folder is in the same folder as where the LifEasier.jar is being run, the program will read your saved information as per normal.

**Q: Can I edit the information in the save files directly?**
**A:** Yes, it is possible but it is not recommended to do so. Directly modifying the save files may result in incorrectly formatted data to be passed into the **LifEasier** program on the next launch, resulting in missing data.
